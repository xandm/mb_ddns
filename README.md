Basic dynamic DNS client for Mythic Beasts DNS API.

See https://www.mythic-beasts.com/support/api/dnsv2/dynamic-dns for details on creating an API key.

Copy `config-example.yaml` to `/etc/mb_ddns.yaml` and customise, or provide its location on the command line, e.g. `./mb_ddns.py ~/.config/mb_ddns.yaml`.

Ensure the config file is not world-readable.
